<font size="3">**What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?**</font>

<font size="1">As stated on their website “BlockFi’s vision is to bridge the worlds of traditional finance and blockchain technology to bring financial empowerment to clients on a global scale.” -- [The BlockFi Team](https://blockfi.com/mission/)

</font>

<font size="3">**Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**</font>

<font size="1">Anyone who wants to buy, borrow, or earn interest on cryptocurrency

- Other (5.5%)

- **They offer a Visa credit card with rewards back on every purchase.** 

  1.5% BTC on every purchase and 2% back in crypto on every purchase over $50k of annual spend. It has no annual fee and no foreign transaction fees. This offer is very competitive as it is still a newish concept earning crypto back instead of flight miles for example.

<font size="3">**What domain of the financial industry is the company in?**</font>

<font size="1">BlockFi is in CBInsights FinTech 250 under Cryptocurrency, as it is a financial cryptocurrency exchange.</font>

<font size="3">**What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?**</font>

<font size="1">Crypto is just over 10 years old so pretty much everything in this domain has been an advancement but the most notable in its time period is obviously the implementation of the blockchain to decentralise banking and make the crypto exchanges excel over traditional financial institutes. Using the blockchain also allows for a greater global accessibility in this domain which is also another major trend in the last 5 years, this and security/privacy are major selling points in this domain right now. 

Another major trend for this domain has been the security and privacy involved, protecting people while they use a new concept is vital and has been a major advancement in the last 5 years especially. 

Decentralising the crypto market has also been a major trend in this domain over the last 5 to 10 years. Optimising time, flexibility and privacy.

<font size="1">BlockFi started as a small start up and is one of the most successful in the industry with its valuation in the billions after just 4 years. 

The impact BlockFi has inflicted is the standard of security and privacy in crypto exchanges and wallets. BlockFi interest account rates have also shaken up the industry as they are very competitive being one of the highest on offer. They offer all of this with basically zero fees as well and this is one of the major impacts throughout its domain.

## <span style="color:turquoise">Recommendations <a name="Recommendations"></a></span>

<font size="3">**If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?**</font>

<font size="1">

1. BlockFi needs to add more crytpocurrencies to its platform, as it is a little behind with the amount of coins this is because of regulation and security measures in the company but is becoming a limitation. They also need to support more Fiat currencies.

2. Once more currencies are added they need to break into trading hard with extremely low fees and a super simple interface, as they don’t offer anything like this close to the top level. 

3. Withdrawal speeds can be sped up, some other platforms outpace BlockFi. Also, the fees and limits just make the withdrawal process less than optimal in this domain. 

4. BlockFi could follow what Paypal is doing since it is a competitor to Paypal. BlockFi should become an online payment system. It should add more payment options like debit cards, bank cards and multiple bank account options, savings accounts etc. It should aim to integrate these new payment and account options to a quick and easy to use online payment like Paypal. They could use Paypal idea and Square’s technology. 

5. Promotions could really help the already incredible growth rate of the company, bigger and better promotions for a short period. 1. BlockFi needs to add more crytpocurrencies to its platform, as it is a little behind with the amount of coins this is because of regulation and security measures in the company but is becoming a limitation. They also need to support more Fiat currencies.

 </font>



<font size="3">**Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**</font>

<font size="1">

1. This would benefit greatly as this is one of the main reasons people don’t use BlockFi and they use its competitors. BlockFi simply doesn’t offer enough in terms of currencies and currency support. If they could get their numbers into the 20 at least even 30+ they would boom and become one of the leaders in its domain. (Gaining more users)

2. Trading is not going to make or break their platform as its not their main focus but if this would be added once more currencies are added it would also start to claim clients from its major competitors like Binance and Coinbase. It would make another major draw factor for clients as most people in the crypto space would like to trade, especially since their platform is better suited to more experienced crypto goers. (Stealing users) 

3. Withdrawal speeds, fees and limits are not devastating, but the future of FinTech is about, global accessibility/no limitations, speed, ease, and cost effectiveness. So, they simply aren’t meeting this criteria with this flaw. So, if this is improved it most likely wouldn’t be ground-breaking but would reach some of its bigger competitors and just eliminate a weakness that is seen in just about every review of the platform. (Staying with the trends, future proofing)

4. This is a very out their innovation to add and would take extensive work, but this would basically set them apart from everyone in this domain and would actually spread them across multiple FinTech domains. They are already venturing into this realm with the interest account and rewards credit card. They could become one of the first major companies that have Paypal’s and Square’s design but with crypto focus instead of Fiat currency. This would not only make them grow phenomenally but make them a giant, one of the biggest companies in the world and the most successful small start up ever just about in its domain. (Expanding, innovation, future proofing and dominating)

5. Promotions and advertising can be a major draw point for some clients since they have amazing offers but some flaws, this can help get the name bigger and persuade people with more rewards. Humans are very susceptible to freebies and rewards. (Drawing intrigue) 

</font>

<font size="3">**What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**</font>

<font size="1">

- Faster withdrawal speeds would be manageable by setting up a standard BlockFi withdrawal or funds transfer API. This would allow direct integration similar to open banking. It would also govern the exchange of data in a consistent matter. A person or another platform or service could programmatically interact with the BlockFi platform which could lead to faster withdrawals and potentially with other open banking solutions, which leads to the technology utilised for the other recommendation. 

- Becoming like Paypal and Square BlockFi would benefit from using an API gateway with published APIs for websites to add BlockFi as a payment gateway, as well as use it to interact with. 
  -	For example: If you were to have a e-commerce store online you would imbed a BlockFi payment gateway. The website would talk to the BlockFi API to pass the required data and the transaction is processed. This would then show complete on the website, and BlockFi could then count your bitcoin accumulations.
